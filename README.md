# credit-risk-classification
Module 20 Challenge

This assignment was relatively simple compared to the unsupervised learning. I'm more confident in the accuracy than with the prior assignment.


**Question:** How well does the logistic regression model predict both the `0` (healthy loan) and `1` (high-risk loan) labels?

**Answer:** The logistic regression model performs in predicting the 0 healthy loan label, achieving a precision and recall of 1.00. This indicates that the model is nearly perfect in identifying healthy loans. For the 1 high-risk loan label, the model has a precision of 0.85 and a recall of 0.91, which shows that it is good at identifying high-risk loans but not as perfect as for healthy loans. The overall accuracy of the model is 0.99, suggesting that it is very reliable in its predictions. The weighted average precision, recall, and f1-score are also high, confirming the model's efficiency in predicting loan statuses accurately.
